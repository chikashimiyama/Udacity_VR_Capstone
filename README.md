Sound Sphere
============

Play with audiovisual instrument

Udacity VR High Immersion Capstone Project

 

 

Introduction
============

Every musical instrument offers an interface for controlling sound, such as
keyboards, strings, sliders etc. What if we can use the VR 3D space as an
control surface of an electronic instrument?

 

Emotion
-------

Playing musical instrument is a JOYFUL experience for all of us but it usually
requires years of practice.

 

Audio Technology
----------------

PureData (http://puredata.info) is an environment for developing interactive
audio signal processing algorithms that can be integrated in another software,
using libPd (https://github.com/libpd). Using libPd created LibPd4UnityTools (
https://github.com/Magicolo/LibPd4UnityTools) in order to facilitate the
connection between Pd and Unity.

 

Target Platform
---------------

Oculus Rift.
